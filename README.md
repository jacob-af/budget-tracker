## About

This full stack application allows the user to keep track of a budget by adding income and expenses. Use of a webpack generated manifest, a service-worker, and IndexedDB allow the user to enter data while the app is offline.

## Usage

Deployed project can be found at [budget-tracker](https://budg3t-track3r.herokuapp.com/)

Upon loading the app, the user can see the current total, and have inputs to enter the name of a transaction, it's value, and whether to add or subtract the funds. Previous transactions can be seen in reverse chronological order as well as rendered as a line chart. If the user loses internet connectivity, entered transactions will be stored locally, and will update to the database when the user regains an internet connection.

## Future_Development

Adding ability to update and or delete entries, sort by values, date, and time.
